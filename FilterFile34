Frame.Ethernet.Address == 00-03-FF-10-C8-68

// Uses High Performance Capture filtering in 3.4 to filter Ethernet Addresses.

// You can use OR and AND to combine multiple filters together.  However,
// longer filters can affect your CPU load and force our parsing engine
// to revert to the 3.3 behavior of buffering frames before filtering.

// High Performance Capture filtering is limited to specific data fields
// using a restricted parser set that is used automatically when every
// field in the specified filter is valid.  Otherwise, we default back to 
// the previous 3.3 behavior where frames are buffered first on disk.
