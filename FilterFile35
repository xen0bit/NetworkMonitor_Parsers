Frame.Ethernet.IPv4.Address == 192.168.1.5

// Uses High Performance Capture filtering in 3.4 to filter IPv4 Addresses.
// Alternate versions depending on your network architecture.  For instance,
// if you are capturing over wireless, your path would instead be:

// Frame.WiFi.Payload.LLC.Snap.IPv4.Address == 192.168.1.5

// You can use OR and AND to combine multiple filters together.  However,
// longer filters can affect your CPU load and force our parsing engine
// to revert to the 3.3 behavior of buffering frames before filtering.

// High Performance Capture filtering is limited to specific data fields
// using a restricted parser set that is used automatically when every
// field in the specified filter is valid.  Otherwise, we default back to 
// the previous 3.3 behavior where frames are buffered first on disk.
