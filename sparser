//#  Title:       SParser - Starting Parser (top-most parent parser)
//#
//#  Details:     NPL, the Network Parser Language, is a new language invented
//#               specifically for parsing network frames. The Network Monitor
//#               team would like to Thank and acknowledge Peter Sollich for
//#               his review of the language and his moral support.
//#
//#  References:  
//#
//#  Comments:    
//#
//####

//
// IMPLEMENTATION NOTES:
//
// a) Parser order should be roughly the same as the protocols appearing in a frame.
//      eg.   Place parent parsers before children in the list below.
//
// b) To load a parser from a different directory, use double-backslashes.
//      eg.   c:\\Temp\\MyWork\\tcp.npl
